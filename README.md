![Hook-up in North Sealand logo](assets/images/hook-up-site-logo.PNG)

[View the live project here.](https://axel713.github.io/hook-up-in-north-sealand/)

Hook-up in North Sealand is a new project, directed primarly to foreigners living in Denmark or tourists who want to take part or begin to discover fishing in the country.

The overall goal is to give its audience a reconciliation of the basic necessary information which is most often scattered accross various danish sites.

As a new fisherman, I intend to also a give some field functionality that help users with following some of the exisiting rules.

## **UX**

User profiles are expected to be very varied. Being mainly targeted to foreigners in Denmark and tourists, variations in culture, background, age range make it difficult to pinpoint a/some specific groups. Nonetheless, to fit the current scandinavic design trends and be easy to use (especially in the field) the new UX must be:

-   with a simple and clear layout.
-   with a colour theme blending sea, nature and the Danish location. It also must be "easy on the eye" especially during levels of low light conditons, since the best fishing times tend to be at dusk/dawn.

### **User Goals**

-   **Know where** I can find essential legal information for fishing in Denmark.
-   **Know where** I can purchase a fishing licence.
-   **Be aware** of Be aware of environmental considerations.

#### **Colours**

The selection of colour is made to include Fit For Work Green logo section proeminent. To make the content easy and pleasant to read, I chose a dedicated white (with gray notes) and black (lighter than standard).
![Colour palette](design-tools/colour-palette/ffw-colour-palette.png)

-   Green #007E2F is used for:
    -   navigation (navigation bar and buttons) and header purposes.
    -   Icon: bars.

-   Black #190B28 is used for text colour.
-   White #EDEDF4 is used as pages' background colour.
-   Yellow #FFD166 is used for background in callout section (alert bar).

#### **Fonts**

For the navigation bar, I have chosen [Red Rose](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Red+Rose?query=red).

For the body and footer, I have chosen [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=mont).

#### **Wireframes**

This site was designed according to a "mobile first" philosophy, using [balsamiq wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/). With it, the basic structure is drawn, as well as changes in layout between mobile and desktop versions.

The current wireframe file (version 04) can be found : [here](design-tools/wireframes/FitForWork_V04.bmpr).

| Mobile Versions                                                                                 | Desktop Versions                                                                                         |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![index page mobile view](design-tools/wireframes/wireframe-images/index-html.png)              | ![index page desktop view](design-tools/wireframes/wireframe-images/index-html-desktop.png)              |
| ![onsite massage mobile view](design-tools/wireframes/wireframe-images/onsite-massage-html.png) | ![onsite massage desktop view](design-tools/wireframes/wireframe-images/onsite-massage-html-desktop.png) |
| ![book trial mobile view](design-tools/wireframes/wireframe-images/book-trial-html.png)         | ![book trial desktop view](design-tools/wireframes/wireframe-images/book-trial-html-desktop.png)         |

Wireframe version historic:

-   V01: original version.
-   V02: based on feedback from my mentor (Dick Vlaanderen). Reduced number of pages.
-   V03: improved the visual attractiveness of the design by giving more breathing space to the different elements.
-   V04: (current): updated book-trial page to add contact details and an image to make it more informative and attractive. Upgraded responsive-design between desktop and mobile content: only form and contact details visible in the latter.

## **Features**

### **Existing Features**

-   Responsive Design

With a _mobile-first_ design principle in mind, the site's layout changes according to the display size, with the most important information shown on mobile-size devices.

-   Easy-to-the-eye colour theme

In particular the blend of a white _with gray notes_ and black _with lighter than standard depth_ gives a relaxing reading environment.

-   Covid-19 Safety information

A modal pop-up placed in the navgation bar informs users of Fit Fo Work's measures to in regards to Covid-19.

-   Contact form

Used to book a massage trial. The form informs the user if they have not completed the mandatory fields of the form, for example: name, email address, etc, and an "Agree to terms and conditions" checkbox. Upon submission of the form, the user gets a notification that the form has been sent and should expect to be contacted by Fit For Work. It must be noted that the current form design is not fully functional (no backend servicing) due to my technology limitations.

-   Social link

Located in footer section.

### **Future Features**

-   Contact form

To design an implement backend to collect the submited information in a database.

-   Additional services

Additional pages that describe further treatment offerings to be implemented.

-   Additional languages

An option for the user to choose to to view the site in English or Danish.

_Note_: whilst JavaScript is not a part of the project curriculum, a customised code has been added to the contact form located in the [book-trial.html](book-trial.html) to allow a confirmation of success pop up modal to function and improve the user experience. The code was generously provided by my mentor (Dick Vlaanderen).

It is **important to note**, that in book-trial.html, it is necessary to add the custom script for the form right before the closing body tag to allow for functionality, overriding the Bootstrap documentation instruction regarding its own scripts.

## **Testing**

### **HTML code validation**

To verify the quality of the written HTML documents, I used the automated [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org) service. The code was tested with the Direct Input tool.

### **CSS code validation**

To verify the quality of the written css document, I used the automated [W3C Markup Validator CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) service. The code was tested with the Direct Input tool.

| Page          | Status                                                                                       | Actions                                                                                        |

### **Overall website test**

I performed regular overall tests of the website by verifying that: images load correctly up, links work, navigation bar works and is responsive, contact form works as intended, text is correctly displayed, testimonial carousel works.

Various members of the Code Institute Slack Community also tested my website, contributing with input to the bug troubleshooting section.

### **Responsiveness**

I tested the site for responsiveness using [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools), by varying width resolution. I also tested it on an [iPhone XR](https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-xr), [Samsung Galaxy S7](https://www.samsung.com/uk/smartphones/galaxy-s7/overview/), [iPad Pro 11](https://www.apple.com/uk/ipad-pro/) and various [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/) based computer with different screen sizes.

It was found to be adequately responsive by myself and some members of the [Code Institute Slack Community](https://code-institute-room.slack.com).

In particular:

-   the collapsable navigation bar functions at the designated resolution.
-   The correct sections are shown/hidden depending on device sizes.

### **Social media link**

The link located in the footer section functions.

### **Contact Form**

-   Tried to submit an empty form and verified that an error message about the required fields appears.
-   Tried to submit the form with an invalid email address and verified that a relevant error message appears.
-   Tried to submit the form with an invalid phone number (alphabetical characters) and verified that a relevant error message appears.
-   Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verified that a success message appears.

### **Bugs and fixes**

I found and fixed various bugs in the final testing phase of the project; those are listed below.

I have also asked my fellow students at the Code Institute to review my site and report any bugs or issues they may discover.

#### **HMTL fixes**

-   In book.trial.html, added "Optional fields" to "Therapies you are interested in".
-   In all .html files, responsive grid 2, right section, added a row to align image on the right-hand side with content below h2 on the left-hand side.

-   In style.css, for #res-gri-1, defined margin-top of 2rem.
-   In style.css, for .img-resp-grid-2, removed margin:auto.

#### **Miscellaneous fixes**
